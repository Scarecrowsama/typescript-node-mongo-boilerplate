[Coveralls Site](https://coveralls.io)

### Notes

Coveralls is used in conjunction with Travis CI/CD in this repo, therefore no additional configurations are needed if you wish to change for a different tool you will need to check the documentation for the changes to be made.

There is one folder called "coveralls" under "src" and under "tests", those can be deleted once you add your own tests as coveralls requires at least one test to trigger.
